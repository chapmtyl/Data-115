### Background

One of the most accepted phenomenons in all of sports is that of home field advantage.  Home field advantage in simple terms is the likelyhood of the home team to win the game based on several different factors such as fans, and familiarity with the field.  However, recently the world has been plagued with the worst pandemic in a century, and while sports have found ways to continue, the stadiums have been empty of fans for over a year now.  Being a fan of soccer myself, I was curious to know what impact the pandemic and lack of fans has had on home field advantage, and whether or not home field advantage is still applicable even without the fans.  The dataset that I have created has the total amount of games won by the home team, the away team, or draw games that occured each season in the English Premier League for the last 13 seasons.
  
### Processing and Cleaning

To collect the data, the following sites were used...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_Premier_League

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Premier_League

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Premier_League

... and I created a .csv file with the total amount of home wins, away wins, and draw games that occured for each of the past 13 seasons.  No cleaning or processing was done for any season with the exception of this current 2020/21 season.  The reasoning behind this was that the current season is not quite over, as each season contains 380 games, and as of 4/23/2021 only 321 games had been played. To account for this, I did the following to the data.

As of 4/23/21, there were 120 home wins, 75 draws and 126 away wins totaling to 321/380 games played

321/380 = 1.1838

120 * 1.1838 = 142 Projected Home Wins

75 * 1.1838 = 89 Projected Draws

126 * 1.1838 = 149 Projected Away Wins
